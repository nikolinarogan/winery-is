## üîÑ Transaction Flow: New Customer Order

**How a customer order transaction works:**

1. **Customer Entry:**  
   The user enters a new customer‚Äôs email and phone number. The system checks that the email is unique.

2. **Payment Method:**  
   The user selects how the customer will pay (cash or card).

3. **Bottle Selection:**  
   The system displays all bottles that are available for sale. The user selects one or more bottles for the order.

4. **Validation:**  
   The system checks that all selected bottles are available, the customer email is unique, and all information is valid.

5. **Transaction Execution:**  
   - A new customer is created (if the email is unique).
   - A new order is created and linked to the customer.
   - The selected bottles are assigned to the order (they become ‚Äúsold‚Äù).
   - If any step fails, the whole transaction is cancelled (no partial changes).
